# CORS and 500 Error Fix Summary

## Issues Identified
1. **CORS Policy Block**: Frontend requests from `https://scissorsproperties.com` were being blocked due to missing CORS headers
2. **500 Internal Server Error**: Backend was returning 500 errors, likely due to missing error handling and database connection issues

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Enhanced CORS Configuration (`app/__init__.py`)
```python
CORS(app, 
     supports_credentials=True, 
     origins=["https://scissorsproperties.com", "https://www.scissorsproperties.com"],
     allow_headers=["Content-Type", "Authorization", "X-Requested-With"],
     methods=["GET", "POST", "PUT", "DELETE", "OPTIONS"])
```

**Changes:**
- Added both `scissorsproperties.com` and `www.scissorsproperties.com` origins
- Explicitly allowed required headers
- Added all necessary HTTP methods including OPTIONS for preflight requests

### 2. Database Connection Error Handling (`app/__init__.py`)
```python
try:
    if not app.config.get('MONGO_URI'):
        raise ValueError("MONGO_URI environment variable is not set")
    client = MongoClient(app.config['MONGO_URI'])
    app.db = client.get_default_database()
    # Test the connection
    app.db.command('ping')
    print("✅ Database connected successfully")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"❌ Database connection failed: {e}")
    app.db = None
```

**Changes:**
- Added proper error handling for database connection
- Added connection testing with ping command
- Graceful fallback if database connection fails

### 3. Enhanced Signup Function Error Handling (`app/auth_controller/auth.py`)
```python
def Signup():
    try:
        # Check if database is available
        if not current_app.db:
            return response_with_code(500, "Database connection not available")
            
        data = RegisterSchema(**request.get_json())
    except ValidationError as e:
        return response_with_code(400, "Validation error", e.errors())
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"❌ Error in Signup validation: {e}")
        return response_with_code(400, "Invalid request data")

    try:
        # ... rest of the function logic ...
        return response_with_code(200, "User registered successfully", str(user['_id']))
        
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"❌ Unexpected error in Signup: {e}")
        return response_with_code(500, "Internal server error during registration")
```

**Changes:**
- Added database availability check
- Wrapped entire function in try-catch blocks
- Added specific error handling for validation errors
- Added graceful email sending (won't fail registration if email fails)

### 4. Added Health Check Endpoint (`app/route_controller/auth_route.py`)
```python
auth_bp.route('/health', methods=['GET'])(lambda: response_with_code(200, "Server is running"))
```

**Changes:**
- Added `/auth/health` endpoint for server status checking
- Useful for debugging and monitoring

## Testing

### Manual Testing
1. **Health Check**: Visit `https://scissorsproperties-backend-production.up.railway.app/auth/health`
2. **CORS Test**: Use browser developer tools to check if CORS headers are present
3. **Registration Test**: Try registering a user from your React frontend

### Automated Testing
Run the provided test script:
```bash
python test_cors.py
```

## Environment Variables Required
Make sure these environment variables are set in your Railway deployment:
- `MONGO_URI`: Your MongoDB connection string
- `SECRET_KEY`: Flask secret key
- `JWT_SECRET_KEY`: JWT secret key
- `FRONTEND_URL`: Your frontend URL (https://scissorsproperties.com)
- Mail configuration variables (if using email features)

## Expected Results
After deploying these changes:
1. ✅ CORS errors should be resolved
2. ✅ 500 errors should be reduced (with proper error messages)
3. ✅ Frontend should be able to communicate with backend
4. ✅ Health endpoint should return 200 status

## Next Steps
1. Deploy these changes to Railway
2. Test the health endpoint first
3. Test registration from your React frontend
4. Monitor logs for any remaining issues
5. If issues persist, check Railway logs for specific error messages

## Troubleshooting
- If CORS still fails, check that your frontend URL exactly matches the configured origins
- If 500 errors persist, check Railway logs for specific error messages
- Ensure all environment variables are properly set in Railway
- Verify MongoDB connection string is correct and accessible
